How and what do ticks do exaclty??

  Ticks are specifically a tracker thing that determine how a note is played, and how TRACKER affects are applied to the playing instrument note. 
  A tick is just an interval of time (an interrupt) and for every line of the tracker, you have x amount of ticks (interrupts). The tick on the first tick of a line will trigger a instrument note to play. Now we samples that can be packed into the processBlock. If the samples run out before the next first tick, too bad. Every other remaining tick will process tracker specific effects and meta devices.

  In MilkyTracker, the timing system is not interrupt/timer based, but sample based. For a given sample rate, you can count the samples from the proessblock and update a tick counter for your timing system. On tick update, you do whatever is necessary.

  - Holds number of channels, the effects for each channel, number of rows, note, instrument




Goals:
Way to start playing a Pattern
Way to change to tick speed
Way to change number of ticks per line
Way to count samples
Way to get notification of tick update
